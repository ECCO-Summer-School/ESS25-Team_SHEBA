# Project SHEBA (Sassie inspired Heat Budget of the Arctic)
## Introduction
This project aims to compute the heat budget of the Arctic using the ECCOv4r5 and LLC1080 output data. As part of the project, we hope to learn how to close the heat budget in ECCOv4 and access, analyze, and store large datasets on an HPC. 


### Collaborators

List all participants on the project. 

| Name | Personal goals | Can help with | Role |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Ali Siddiqui | I want to learn how to access the ECCO data on the cloud, and analyze budget terms in the LLC1080 run.  | I can help with analyzing and understanding the heat budget terms in ECCOv4  | Project Lead |
| Marie Zahn|  |  | Project Lead |

### The problem

The Arctic is warming at an unprecendented rate. One of the first places on Earth to experience the effects of anthropogenic climate change, the Arctic ocean is one the most important places to evaluate the heat budget in observations and models. ECCO provides a perfect opportunity to do so. With closed heat, volume, and salt budgets we can study the processes that drive the changes in ocean heat content. 
## Data and Methods

### Data

we use the ECCOv4r5, the latest release of the ECCO state estimate (1992-2019) along with the LLC1080 high resolution simulation that covers the period 2014-2021. Both datasets are available online at various S3 servers. Notebooks that describe how to access them are provided in this repo.  


## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

List the specific project goals or research questions you want to answer. Think about what outcomes or deliverables you'd like to create (e.g. a series of tutorial notebooks demonstrating how to work with a dataset, results of an anaysis to answer a science question, an example of applying a new analysis method, or a new python package).

* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* ...

### Tasks

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (team members will use the scikit-learn python library)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3
* ...

## Project Results

Use this section to briefly summarize your project results. This could take the form of describing the progress your team made to answering a research question, developing a tool or tutorial, interesting things found in exploring a new dataset, lessons learned for applying a new method, personal accomplishments of each team member, or anything else the team wants to share.

You could include figures or images here, links to notebooks or code elsewhere in the repository (such as in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder), and information on how others can run your notebooks or code.
