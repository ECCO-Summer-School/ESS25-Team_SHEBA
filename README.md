# Project SHEBA (Sassie inspired Heat Budget of the Arctic)
## Introduction
This project aims to compute the heat budget of the Arctic using the ECCOv4r5 and LLC1080 output data. As part of the project, we hope to learn how to close the heat budget in ECCOv4 and access, analyze, and store large datasets on an HPC. 


### Collaborators

### The problem

The Arctic is warming at an unprecendented rate. One of the first places on Earth to experience the effects of anthropogenic climate change, the Arctic ocean is one the most important places to evaluate the heat budget in observations and models. ECCO provides a perfect opportunity to do so. With closed heat, volume, and salt budgets we can study the processes that drive the changes in ocean heat content. 
## Data and Methods

### Data

we use the ECCOv4r5, the latest release of the ECCO state estimate (1992-2019) along with the LLC1080 high resolution simulation that covers the period 2014-2021. Both datasets are available online at various S3 servers. Notebooks that describe how to access them are provided in this repo.  


## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

We wanted to close the heat budget in ECCOv4r5 and the LLC1080 run and then look at different regions of the Arctic, and what the heat budget could tell us about these regions. 

* Close the heat budget in ECCOv4r5
* Close the heat budget in LLC1080
* Evaluate the budget terms for the Arctic using the two model outputs
